Description: Deep learning has proven to be one of state-of-the-art tools
    in object recognition and natural language processing,
    and has been applied to many fields including life sciences.
    Deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers of neural network
    which is one of traditional machine learning algorithms.
    The deep neural networks are able to solve problems
    that are difficult to solve with the conventional machine learning algorithms.
    At present, various architectures of deep neural networks have been published,
    especially convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) are well known.
    CNN is known to be excellent in computer visions such as object recognition and object detection,
    while RNN is known to be excellent in time-series data analysis and natural langauge processing.
    In this workshop, we will introduce both CNN and RNN to build model for predictions.
